IN the organization of the office of chief executive of great col onial dependencies is involved a political problem of the first magni tude The responsibilities of the government of an alien race often permeated with discontent and difficult to control require the deposit in the local executive of great and impressive powers but there must be assurance that these powers will be exercised in subordination to the will of the home government and in accord with standards of humane and enlightened policy Public opinion in a dependency cannot be relied upon for control and is always characterized by moods of hostility Public opinion and frequently official opinion in the metropolitan country is usually ill informed and incapable of imagination The history of certain of these great offices like the viceroy of India or the governorgeneral of Dutch India or French IndoChina perfectly illustrates the dilemma It exhibits both the evils of entrusting undisciplined authority to officers imperfectly responsible and also the spectacle of rare capacity made impotent by a superior control that was distrustful jealous and incapable of allowing adequate discretion Of the several impressive offices of this character still existent in the modern world not the least in importance and the oldest in point of history is under the sovereignty of the United States and the recurring problem of its organization which baffled Spanish political effort for more than three centuries now occupies the at tention of American statesmanship The office of governor and captaingeneral of the Philippines was created by royal cedula of King Philip II in I567 immediately upon receipt of news of the successful occupation of the archipelago and was conferred upon the adelantado and conqueror of the islands Don Miguel Lopez de Legazpi For the space of two hundred years it underwent little development but continued to illustrate perhaps more clearly than any other similar position in the Spanish colonial empire the typical character and vicissitudes of the institution Then toward the close of the eighteenth cen tury it shared in those important administrative changes which in America are associated with the work of Galvez It entered on a third phase of its history after the loss of the SpanishAmerican empire and from about I840 down to 1897 was together with the 288Governor General of the PAdtiizpines 289 whole body of colonial administration the object of constant solici tude and modification This period is most instructive because it exhibits a great office facing the modern difficulties of colonial government and after decades of contest ending in failure to sustain the sovereignty of Spain Continued under American occupation the governorgeneralship of the Philippines exists today as one of the disturbing but great and magnetic positions upon which depend the efforts of the white race to control the political future of tropical peoples It is pro posed in this paper to view this office in outlitie in its several periods and offer some reflections based on a comparision of Spanish and American experience The office of Philippine governor was created on the model which had originated in Spain and been developed in the New World Seventythree years intervened between the first voyage of Columbus and the definite occupation of the Philippines and in this period the Spaniards had had some exceptionally severe lessons and gained much hard experience in colonial empire This Ameri can experience was behind the Philippine conquest and determined its character The institutions whereby Spain for 250 years gov erned her vast empire were carried as a nearly completed system to the Philippines A great body of law defining the powers and relations of colonial officers already existed and was put into effect in the new possession Thus the Philippines were spared a repeti tion of the periods of extravagant waste of life and accompanying disorder that fill the early pages of the history of most Spanish American colonies The list of governors exhibits not a few who were weak and inept but no Ovando nor Pedrarias During the period of conquest and settlement of the Philippines America was relied on to supply most of the Philippine governors and not a few had developed in those remarkable training schools of colonial officials the audiencias of the New World The adelan tado Legazpi a model of courage prudence and humane modera tion was appointed to lead the expedition that effected the conquest from the post of escribano mayor and alcalde ordinarto of Mexico Sande 1575I580 was an oidor of the audiencia of New Spain and Gonzalo Ronquillo 158o1583 and Dr de Vera I584I590 officials of the same government Bravo de Acuna I6o2I6o6 had been

Barrozws Another field of promotion to the post of Philippine governor was the army in Flanders Between I6o9 and I678 at least six governors Juan de Silva i6o9i6i6 Fajardo y Tenza I6I5 I624 Nifio de Tabora i626i632 Salcedo I663I668 a native of Brussels Manuel de Leon I669I677 a hero of Liutzen and Nordlingen and Vargas Hurtado i678i684 were appointed from Spanish armies serving in the Low Countries Several of these men were nobles or members of distinguished orders To the intrepid and ambitious soldiers and lawyers of that day the Philippine appointment unquestionably appeared an opportunity for audacious service in the East and a steppingstone to higher rewards in the great offices of the New World but the vast distance the hardships of the long voyage the tropical disease that assailed so many and the bitter trials of the office itself wore out these men with rare exceptions and hardly one returned Few indeed like Manrique de Lara were able to endure a long term of service in his case the unprecedented period of ten years and the persecu tions of a severe residencia and return to Spain to die of old age in his native Malaga To most the Philippine appointment was the end The selection of the governor was personally made by the king from a list of officers proposed by the Council of the Indies When Niino de Tabora was appointed not less than ten names were pro posed including one man de Vivero who had served an interim ap pointment as governor at Manila and returned to the governorship of Panama1 To read the terse dossiers of these nominees is to see outlined in a few words the adventurous lives of the Spanish con querors in the New World and the wide field of services presented by Spains amazing empire The appointment was set for eight years but in case the governor survived it sometimes extended to nine or ten The average how ever was low and drew frequent unfavorable comment especially when contrasted with the long periods of service of the dignitaries of the Church During the latter part of the seventeenth and most of the eigh teenth century when Spanish national life sank after the exhaust ing efforts of a hundred years of stupendous conquest emigration to the islands nearly ceased commercial restrictions checked eco nomic development and torpor succeeded the intense energy of an earlier time In this situation the governorship was repeatedly conferred upon the Archbishop of Manila or one of the other 1 Report of the council on the appointment of a governor of the Philip pines  I625 Blair and Robertson The Philippinie Islands XXII 27Governor General of the Pzilzpines 291 prelates After the eighteefith century the governor of the Philip pines was nearly always a military or a naval officer of high rank In the beginning the Philippines were regarded as an outpost for further eastern conquests the Spice Islands and Malacca the coasts of Siam and IndoChina were all essayed by Spanish ex peditions and designs of conquest of Japan and China filled the feverish brains of some of these daring exiles But the sparse population of the archipelago less than a million natives and only a few hundred Spaniards the insufficiency of revenues and the enormous difficulties of Pacific transport eventually enforced a policy of economy and extreme simplicity of administration The governor represented the allembracing authority of the king He was governor of the civil administration appointed the provin cial chiefs or alcaldes mayores and except where these officers received royal appointments the other administrative officials As civil head he sent and received embassies from the countries of the East and made peace and war As captaingeneral he commanded all the armed forces in the colony equipped fleets to invade the Moluccas or repel the pirates of Mindanao built or repaired the fortifications of Manila and the naval yard of Cavite and built and despatched the Acapulco Galleon  eventually the sole communication with Mexico and Spain The perilous situation of the colony the menace of China and Japan the struggle for the Moluccas the centuries of Malay piracy and the incursions of the Dutch gave great prominence to the military responsibilities and the functions of the governor as captaingeneral He had full re sponsibility for the revenues nominated to encomiendas until these grants disappeared in the eighteenth century and established the estancos or government monopolies He also allotted the boletas or tickets entitling the holder to cargo space on the Acapulco galleon As vicepatron and representative of the king he nominated to church benefices and controlled the financial support of the missions For the discharge of these numerous services he had relatively few assistants A royal treasurer an accountant a factor the fiscal of the audiencia a teniente del rey who commanded the military plaza of Manila and the fieldmarshal and captains of his army were the usual officers The audiencia definitely established in I595 served both as a supreme court with civil and criminal jurisdiction and as an administrative and legislative commission Of this body the governor was president until I844 and his relations to it form an interesting study The policv of Spain was to make the office of governor one of292 D P Barrows impressive dignity He was the personal representative of the king and so far as the slender resources of Manila permitted lived in state The official ceremonies attending his arrival and induction into office were elaborately prescribed A guard of halberdiers at tended him when he walked abroad2 and a nmounted escort when he rode These formalities however inconsistent with the actual re sources of the position were highly esteemed by the Spaniards A complaint filed by the audiencia with the king against the governor Tello de Guzman in I598 has mainly to do with the offense of attending a meeting of that body in a short colored coat and a hat with plumes3 While encouraging and abetting the heroic enterprises of her expatriated sons Spain early sought to provide balances and re strictions to their overtopping ambitions These attempted limita tions can perhaps nowhere be better studied than in the history of the Philippines where the remoteness of the colony and the difficulty of Spanish supervision occasioned situations of the most sensational character Some of the practices used as checks by the Spanish government would not be approved by the more advanced experi ence of the present day but they are at least characteristic of the thought of the period which was singularly distrustful and counted no public servant too loyal or exalted to be watched and restrained In the first place Spanish officialdom encouraged direct report on the policy and character of the governor from subordinate officials and from the ecclesiastical administration From the foundation of the colony at Manila other royal officials than the governor wrote directly to the king Of the first expedition to settle the Philippines Legazpi the treasurer Lavezaris and the factor Mirandaola all wrote independently to Philip II The fiscal Ayala in I589 wrote expressing complaints both of civil and ecclesiastical administration The ayuntamiei to of Manila in i6oi registered its grievances against the oidor and lieutenantgovernor Dr Antonio Morga A letter of Bishop Santibaiiez of I598 informs the king that Governor Tello de Guzman had called together all the honor able people even to the master of camp and all the captains and while they stood bareheaded berated them worse than he would his cobbler  You dont realize that I can have all your heads cut off and you think that I dont know that you have written to the king against me Your majesty  says the bishop in another letter 2 The antique halberds of this guard which was suppressed in i868 were part of the military trophies of the American army after the capture of Manila The

of Don Francisco Tello but should picture to yourself the universal idea of all vices brought to the utmost degree and placed in a lawyer If one were to seek faithfully over all Spain for a man of most debauched conscience even the vilest and most vicious to come to this country and corrupt it with his example there could not be found one more so than he4 It does not appear that the Council of the Indies or the king ever followed the practice of acquainting the governor with such attacks as these upon his policy or his character nor do they appear to have been moved thereby to any decisive action but we must suppose that they had their effect in creating distrust at the Spanish court undermining its confidence in the governor and weakening the loyal support of his efforts Modern administration follows the principle of requiring official correspondence between the govern ment of a dependency and the home authorities to proceed within the cognizance of the chief executive of the dependency and presentday standards of loyalty and of subordination forbid irre sponsible criticism but Spain proceeded upon the different principle of setting subordinates to watch their superiors and trusted to jealousy pique and selfinterest to expose the deficiencies or corrupt character of those set in authority The legitimate balance upon the powers of the governor was the audiencia The Audiencia of Manila was created on the Ameri can model and was the tenth to be established by the Spanish gov ernment in their organization of empire5 It was first erected in I584 under the presidency of the governor Dr Santiago de Vera but was suppressed largely for reasons of economy in 1590 and reestablished in I598 by a royal decree dated November 26 1595 On the vacancy of the office of governor the audiencia regularly assumed the duties of the position the direction of military affairs being confided to the maestre de campo or more usually to one member of the audiencia6 It had the power to grant encomiendas of Indians if the governor neglected this duty It reported annually on the operation of local government and was a board for the audit of accounts and for the

Antonio Morga in his Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas first published in Mexico City in I609 Writ ing from personal knowledge Morga states that the governor attended privately to all that related to war and government with the advice of the audiencia in difficult matters that he tried the criminal offenses of regular paid soldiers but294 D P Barrows acuerdo it deliberated upon matters of government and administra tion and participated with the governor in the enactment of local ordinances It actually discharged certain commissions such as the management of the praedial tithes the public lands temporalities and the fondos de Agaiia which seem to have been funds for the support of the establishment in the Marianas Islands or the Ladrones8 It appears to have been usually in accord with the governor both in support of his general policy and in the inter minable and disastrous disputes which arose between the governors and the ecclesiastical authorities It was the Church that constituted the real check upon the power of the governor of the Philippines The conflicts which arose be tween the governors and the archbishops of Manila were never resolutely dealt with by the Spanish crown nor were the causes of enmity settled The result was an obvious impairment of authority which nearly brought the colony to ruin The struggle became acute about the middle of the seventeenth century under Governor Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera No Philippine gover nor of the seventeenth century more impresses the imagination than this active and valiant man about whose character a tempest of argument has waged He dealt the Moros of Mindanao the heaviest blow that these pirates were to receive until the middle of the nineteenth century but his rule is also associated with the loss of Formosa and of the Portuguese colony of Macao When relieved by his successor in I644 he was subjected to bitter charges by his opponents in his residencia and for five years was held a prisoner in the fortresses of Santiago and Cavite  A strange turn of fortune exclaims a contemporary writer the Dominican friar Navarrete Don Sebastian had been the most absolute and the most dreaded lord in the world The conflict between priest and soldier long continued Governor Diego de Salcedo in i668 was made a prisoner by the Commissioner of the Inquisition and died at sea while being sent to Mexico for trial Governor Vargas Hurtado I678i684 suffered excommunication and after a restidencia of four years died at sea on the way to Mexico The troubles of Governor Bustamente with the archbishop and the religious orders led to his assassination in I719 that these had a right of appeal to the audiencia that he sat with the audiencia for the trial of civil and criminal cases and with this body provided what was necessary for the administration of finances that the audiencia each year audited the accounts of the royal officers and after balancing them sent them to the  Tribunal of Accounts at Mexico

residencia was a peculiarly Spanish institution It was the trial and audit of accounts of an official at the end of his term by his successor It frequently occupied months and even years of time and involved a retiring executive in great delay and expense and not infrequently in heavy penalties The case of Corcuera has already been referred to and some of his successors were hardly more fortunate The Italian traveller Gemelli Careri who visited the Philippines in I697 thus recorded his impression of the proceeding This Grandeur and Power of the governor is somewhat eclipsd by a dreadful Trial

before the Judge who is generally the Successor in the Government by Special Commission from the King and his Supream Council of the Indies After citing the cases of Corcuera Fajardo and Manrique de Lara the last of whom after a life of extraordinary adventure ending with his residentcia at Manila regained his native land to die in orders Gemelli records In short since the Islands were Conquerd no Governor has returned to Spain but he and one more for all of them either break their Hearts at their Tryal or Dye with Hardship by the way It is certain this Tryal is worth one hundred thousand Crowns to the new governor which he that goes off must have ready to come off well in this dreadful Tryal9 It can hardly be doubted that the prospect of this bitter experi ence awaiting a governor at the termination of his office undermined his courage and weakened his conduct of affairs Besides the ordeal of the residencia the government of the Philippines was occasionally subjected to the inspection of a visi tador In I631 the oidor Rojas of the audiencia of Mexico was sent to the Philippines in this capacity and suspended the oidores of the Manila audiencia The exact relation between the administra tion of the Philippines and that of Mexico and the degree of control exercised by the latter over the former are somewhat difficult to determine Theoretically the Philippines like the captaincies general of Yucatan and Guatemala were under the jurisdiction of the viceroy of New Spain The viceroy or sometimes the audiencia of Mexico repeatedly designated the ad interim successor to a gov ernor of the Philippines until the appointment could be settled by the king During the suspension of the Manila audiencia cases 9 Churchill Collection of Voyages IV 4II296 D P Barrows were regularly appealed to the audiencia at MIexico City The Commissioner of the Inquisition in the Philippines was an agent of the Holy Office in Mexico All communication for several cen turies between the Philippines and Spain lay through the Acapulco galleon Mexico was relied upon for financial and military support and for an annual subsidy or situado such as was also furnished to the financially weak governments of Venezuela Havana or Yuca tan Yet the actual degree of oversight does not seem to have been great nor to have had appreciable influence upon the conduct of Philippine affairs The Spanish system as above described was undeniably fatal to the initiative independence and vigor of her governors Placed in a difficult situation distant from the Spanish court by half the cir cumference of the globe compelled to rely upon Mexico for eco nomic support the focus of jealousy and contention balked by ecclesiastical rivals and civil associates and conscious of the grim day of reckoning at the end of their terms the governors of the Philippines during most of the eighteenth century sank in character and their achievements were too futile to be recalled The task of reorganizing and reinvigorating the government of the Philippines began with the last third of the eighteenth century and continued with fluctuations down to the end of I898 The higher intelligence of the nation from time to time discerned the weaknesses of the organization and indicated remedies but reforms were never carried through with completeness and the end was revolt and disaster The history of these attempts to modernize the Spanish administration of the Philippines is most instructive but only its main outlines can be indicated here The capture of Manila by the English in I 762 aroused the Spanish government to the appointment and support of governors of ability among them Anda y Salazar and Basco y Vargas The latter who placed the finances of the Philippines upon an inde pendent basis through the establishment of the tobacco monopoly and who did something to encourage agriculture and industries was also responsible for attempting in the administration of the Philippines that separation of governmental and financial admin istration which had been effected in the viceroyalties of Mexico and Peru On recommendation of Basco there was issued the royal order of July 7 I784 creating the Intendency of the Army and of Finance and to this position was appointed an oidor of the audiencia Carvajal This official established in the islands five subordinate intendencies and submitted plans for the fiscal and agriGovernor General of the Pkhili5pines 297 cultural development of the islands The new organization how ever was shortlived In I787 the superintendence of finance by royal decree devolved once more upon the governor and captain general The modification of the earlier unspecialized centraliza tion of authority in the direction of segregating financial administra tion rested upon a sufficiently definite theory to commend itself to Spanish authority and after a halfcentury of experiment the finan cial administration was reorganized as the Intendencia de Hacienda The governor continued to be the  superior head  of this as well as other branches but the immediate direction was confided to the intendente general0 A further specialization of i86i deprived the governorgeneral of his judicial powers at the same time the audiencia was divested of its administrative and consultative functions and became simply the supreme court for the archipelago1 With this change there was created a new body advisory to the governor known as the Council of Administration Consejo de Adrninistracion made up of high officials civil military and ecclesiastic A minor advisory body was the Board of Authorities Junta de Autoridades The principle that the Spanish sought to apply here is one which has been widely used in the colonial administration of the French the Dutch and the English namely to concentrate executive authority in a single person but to subject the exercise of this authority to the expert advice of responsible associates Expectations of the useful ness of this body in the Philippines do not seem however to have been realized and at the time of the ending of its existence it was declared a useless organization2 Its last assembling took place in the city of Manila under the guns of Deweys fleet and amidst the general apprehension that prevailed on that occasion it appears to have rendered no particular service Still further specialization took place with the organization of a general department of civil administration The conception of this reform was to segregate from military affairs and from the determination of policy the execution of functions having to do with civil service and with the development of the islands people and resources The Direccion General de Adminirstracion Civil was decreed as early as i85813 but actually established in i874 and the position of director was occupied in the last decades of Spanish rule by a number of men 10 The decree is

It had two branches Gobierno and Fomento and embraced the bureaus inspecciones of mines forests public works poor relief sanitation and public instruction As advisory bodies to the chiefs of these bureaus there were formed a number of consultative boards on the principle above noted In case of death or absence the governorgeneral was succeeded by the Segundo Cabo a general next in command of the military forces and in case of the latters disability and the absence of another army officer of general rank a decree of I862 provided that the government should be exercised by the naval officer in command of the Philippine station14 With the awakening of new interest in dependencies observable in the last halfcentury of the Spanish period and with the creation in I863 of the Ministerio de Ultramar or Colonies15 initiative in legislation seems to have passed to the officialdom in Spain This appears to have been increasingly so after the establishment of steamship connection by way of the Suez Canal and the connection of Manila by telegraph cable with the government at Madrid Before this period the development of the Philippine administra tion seems to have been largely in the hands of the governors at Manila subject to the approval of the government in Spain thus the governorship of Claveria 1844I849 was characterized by the initiation of many reforms the establishment of new provincial governments the bestowal of surnames upon the natives the cor rection of the calendar and the final suppression of piracy and his proposals seem to have invariably found approval at Madrid Probably no governor after Claveria made so original an impression upon the islands What the later governors did effect however was to reflect the changes in the politics of Spain The momentary triumph of liberal politics at Madrid meant encourage ment to the aspiration of the natives of the Philippines frequently to be followed by the adoption of a conservative policy and the appointment of a representative of reaction Thus the period of advancement and reform from I880 to I888 represented by the liberal governors Primo de Rivera Jovellar and Terrero was followed by the reactionary rule of General Valeriano Weyler i888i8g9 whose name is familiar to Americans through his dis astrous government of Cuba and who exemplified both the possi bilities and the abuses of the office as it was

Philippines 299 Neither in the Philippines nor in the Western Hemisphere was there ever a colonial legislature established under Spanish authority This impairment of legislative responsibility in the colony had its undoubted effect in retarding and discouraging the progress of the government and gave to colonial laws the effect of detach ment from the actual conditions which they were meant to remedy In spite of their august source and the solemnity of their promulga tion it is of interest to note how frequently they were disregarded Morga writing as early as 1597 states frankly that royal decrees sent to the Philippines by His Majesty are mostly suspended or not effectively observed7 Indeed the Spanish authorities at Madrid seemed to hesitate to give full and immediate effect to their de terminations and to have promoted the development of a power in the local government to suspend or limit the action of a decree pending further correspondence18 This power of the cu mlase as it came to be known was sometimes exercised in matters of great significance Two titles of the Civil Code promulgated for the Philippines in I889 was suspended and the greater part of the Civil Marriage Act of 1870 suppressed by the governor general This has left the Philippines without any law of divorce except as contained in Las Partidas9 The radical decree of Moret transforming the Dominican University of Santo Tomas into a government institution was entirely withheld from publication by the governorgeneral and never went into force The reform law of local government the  Maura Decree was made effective only in certain provinces and had hardly become operative when the Spanish system fell before the American conquest of the islands20 The city of Manila was captured by the American expeditionary forces on August I3 i898 and on the following day terms of capitulation were signed From this date American government in the Philippines begins General Wesley Merritt commanding the

governors were very extensive and had an important influence upon the subsequent government of the archipelago Act ing under authority from the President of the United States and in the absence of Congressional legislation the military governors ex ercised a most liberal legislative power By proclamation and by general orders they continued in operation the municipal law that had prevailed under the Spanish government reestablished a system of courts including provostcourts and the supreme court or audiencia and for the trial of criminal offenses subsequently estab lished a system of military commissions22 Where the Spanish law was believed to need correction it was unhesitatingly reformed An entirely new code of criminal procedure introducing into the juris prudence of the islands the English principles of search warrants and the writ of habeas corpus was promulgated by General Order No 58 April 23 1900 and is still the law of criminal procedure for the archipelago23 The law of civil marriage which had long been a question of intense political and ecclesiastical controversy was similarly promulgated24 Under military stupervision municipal governments were set up and first one and subsequently another more elaborate municipal code was decreed Military authority put into prompt operation provisional tariff laws and immigration regu lations which excluded the Chinese from entrance into the islands It was quite in keeping with the past powers of the position and with the policy long followed by the Spanish governors of Manila that General Otis should have commissioned a general officer to pro ceed to the Sulu archipelago and negotiate with the Sultan of Sulu a treaty of peace and protection This document which was secured with difficulty and misapprehension on both sides followed the traditional lines of Spanish policy in handllng this semiindependent Malay power One article of the treaty however that recognized slavery in the Sulu archipelago was disapproved by the President of the linited States Following closely along the lines of tradi tional Spanish authority also was the power exercised by the military governor to expel or exile undesirable persons This power was 22 Report of MajorGeneral McArthur I90I II 42 43 23 Printed in the Public Laws passed by the Philippine Commission J 10o82 24 General Order No 68 December I899

Was it also the tradition of the cumplase which induced General Otis to omit certain provisions and modify others of President McKinleys notable proclamation of American sovereignty cabled to Manila at the end of December I898 25 On the administrative side the government as finally constituted by American military and civil authorities shows even more defi nitely the influence of the Spanish institutions and traditions that had preceded it Except in the single case of the presidency of the United States American prejudice has been strong against conferring a centralized administrative control upon a single executive head The American state governor while he has risen in recent years to a position of great political importance is in no case the executive head of state administration which is distributed among state officers having a similar tenure with the governor or confided to commis sions and boards only partially under his control The same dis position has manifested itself in the governments for such terri tories as Hawaii and Alaska In neither of these is the governor of the territory the centre of the administration and the recog nized avenue of communication between all departments of the federal and local governments Such a diffusion of responsibility was happily prevented in the Philippines first we may believe by the abiding influence of the office of governorgeneral under Spain and in the second place by the period of military government now being described As branches of civil administration were recreated dur ing the period of military governorship these offices were not sub ordinated to departments at Washington but were made responsible to the military governor The possession of captured funds and property occasioned prompt action with respect to those branches of Spanish administra tion which had been embraced in the Intendencia General de Haci enda By General Order No 5 September I7 I898 the office of intendente general was

its col lections and laboratory and on April I4 of the same year the Forestry Bureau took up the forestry work of the former In speccion General de Montes The organization of these offices as well as others which followed under legislation of the Philippine Commission took on a bureaucratic character and thus from the beginning Philippine administration in American hands was unified centralized and made responsible to the chief executive of the archipelago Superficial critics and observers of the Philippine government have on a few occasions advocated the placing of one or another field of Philippine administration as for example education under the direction of the corresponding bureau of the United States federal service Fortunately such suggestions have received no encouragement Both American and European experience fully justify the course which Philippine administration has taken The French experimented for years under the influence of assimila tion ideas with an attempt to administer Algeria through exten sions to their African possession of the administrative work of the several ministries at Paris During this period which extended from i88i to I896 local officials in the several departments reported not to the governorgeneral at Algiers but to their respective min istries of the national government This system of services rat taches gave such unsatisfactory results that a senatorial commis sion under the chairmanship of M Jules Ferry reported in I892 in favor of its abandonment The policy of centralization under the governorgeneral was inaugurated with generally excellent results26 Alaska is a present example of a dependency where administrative authority instead of being concentrated in the territorial governor is distributed among numerous local representatives of services not united who report to their distant heads at Washington The unanimous voice of those qualified to judge of the workings of this decentralized system testifies to its disadvantages 26 Girault Principes de Colonisation et de Legislation Coloniale 1904 II 388 389GovernorGeneral of the Philiz5pines 303 On September I I900 the Philippine Commission composed of Hon William H Taft of Ohio Professor Dean C Worcester of Michigan Hon Luke E Wright of Tennessee Hon Henry C Ide of Vermont and Professor Bernard Moses of California entered upon its official responsibilities in the Philippines Its powers were defined in the Presidents instructions to the commission transmitted through the Secretary of War under date of April 7 J90027 Its general mandate was to continue and perfect the work of organiz ing and establishing civil government already commenced by the military authorities  On the first day of September that part of the power of government in the Philippine Islands which was of a legislative nature was to be transferred from the military governor to the commission This was specifically described as including the powers of taxation and appropriation of public funds establishment of an educational system of a civil service of courts and municipal and departmental governments It was further provided that the commission should have the power to appoint officers under the judicial educational and civil service systems and in the municipal and departmental governments as shall be provided for  It seems that the original intention of the President of the United States in appointing the Philippine Commission was to create a plural executive The instructions read  The commissioners    will meet and act as a board and the Hon William H Taft is designated as president of the board Power and responsibility obviously were collegiate and not individual The president of the board was clearly only a presiding officer However as the Philip pine insurrection drew to a close in the spring of I9OI and the improvement in the military condition of the archipelago warranted the establishment of a complete civil government and the substitu tion for the office of military governor of one of a civil character the plan for a collegiate executive was changed and on June 2I the Secretary of War issued to the president of the commission an appointment as civil governor of the Philippine Islands with the power to exercise the executive authority in all civil affairs in the government of the Philippine Islands heretofore exercised in such affairs by the military governor of the Philippines  The appointment provided that the power to appoint civil officers heretofore vested in the Philippine Commission or in the military governor will be exercised by the civil governor with the advice and consent of the Commission The military governor by the same order was relieved from the performance of civil duties 27

sufficiently restored Under date of October 29 I90I President Roosevelt appointed Mr Luke E Wright vicegovernor with authority to act in the ab sence or incapacity of the civil governor The tendency of  government by commission  is to work away from the principle of collegiate responsibility with which commis sion government begins and commit specific responsibilities to indi vidual members As a consequence unless by a rigid practice all important actions of individual members are reviewed and approved in commission the principle of joint responsibility is impaired This was the development which the Philippine Commission eventually underwent Acting under instructions from the Secretary of War issued on September 6 I90I the commission enacted Act No 222 providing for the organization of four departments Interior Com merce and Police Finance and Justice and Public Instruction to the head of which departments the President through the Secretary of War appointed the four original colleagues of Mr Taft Sec tion 5 of this act provides that the secretaries shall exercise the executive control conferred upon them under the general supervision of the civil governor and that the executive control of the central government over provincial and municipal governments and the civil service shall be exercised directly by the civil governor through an executive secretary It is difficult to assert definitely how the principle of collegiate responsibility assumed when the Philippine Commission was created has worked out The other members of the Philippine Commission now consisting of nine members altogether are not mere adjutants or cabinet secretaries of the governorgeneral They like himself are appointees of the President of the United States They may outrank him in length of service and experience and may and fre quently have differed from him on matters of policy Their over sight of the branches of administration committed to them and of the bureaus in which this administration is organized is to a large degree independent of the governorgeneral28 The governorgen eral in the absence of a secretary however may assume the direction of his department and on certain branches of the admin istration as for instance constabulary and the preservation of public order the policy of the govermorgeneral has usually been decisive 28 By the rules of the commission the governorgeneral and each secretary is a standing committee of one on all matters pertaining to the particular depart ment which each represents Commission Journal First Philippine Legislature inaugural session p 7I and second session p 79GovernorGeneral of thePhiliApines 305 He possesses the power to proclaim martial law suspend the ordi nary civil rights granted by the Philippine Bill and even to concen trate the population but he must exercise these extraordinary powers with the approval of the Philippine Commission He has moreover the right to inspect and even personally correct any branch of administration whatever The custom followed by all of the chief executives of making frequent trips through the provinces and by personal observation satisfying themselves as to the workings of insular and provincial administration has naturally led to the gov ernorgenerals taking cognizance of the working of all departments of government Furthermore he may direct the dismissal of any official except a justice of the supreme court a Philippine com missioner or the insular auditor and this great disciplinary power makes his authority respected by all elements of administration Furthermore while the appointments of subordinate officials are regularly approved by the heads of departments the directors of bureaus and the assistant directors are made by the governor general Good policy recommends consultation between him and the head of a department concerned and this consultation is usually had but there have been undoubted instances of conflict of desire and in these cases the will of the governorgeneral appears to have prevailed Furthermore the civil service regulations are promul gated by the governorgeneral and his power over these rules and their operation appears to be complete Thus it is doubtful if the legal relation existing between him and the heads of the departments is a proper one The survival of collegiate responsibility is of ques tionable advantage The principle recognized in other colonial governments of making the governorgeneral alone responsible for executive policy and limiting the function of his colleagues to that of an advisory council possesses undoubted advantages Dissensions between members of the commission which the governorgeneral was powerless to correct or override and which could only be settled at Washington by what is necessarily a slow process have un doubtedly embarrassed the governorgeneral in the fulfillment of his responsibility and have in a considerable degree been responsible for a decline in the standing and effectiveness of the commission itself 21 By the  Philippine Bill approved July I i902 Congress ap proved ratified and confirmed the actions of the President of the United States in

provided that laws of the Philippine Commission up to that time enacted by authority of the President of the United States should thereafter read  by authority of the United States Y30 The above leglslation comprises the principal acts establishing the office of chief executive in the Philippines and defining its powers These powers have however been further amplified in two ways by acts of the Philippine Commission and of the Philippine legislature and by the assumptlion of certain powers as inherent in or traditional to the office of Philippine governor31 Among the powers of the goverorgeneral which have been developed by action of the legislative authority is a very considerable ordinance power  The European practice of confining a statute to a bare declaration of principles or polfcy and authorizing the development of details by  Orders in Council or deUrets of the executive is so little understood in America that where such a prac tice arises under an American govemment it deserves attention A statute of an American legislature too frequently aims to cover every minor detail and antcipate every situation that may arise in the administration of the law The rigidity thus imposed occasions constant amendment by subsequent legislatt res The absence of any clear conception of ordinance power in the minds of the Philippine Commission led to their expressing the legislative will in minute detail The result is that the bulk of the actsthey amount to exactly i8oopassed by the commission during the period of its sole legislative authority from I900 to i907 are not laws or lois in the French sense but minor amplifica tions suspensions and administrative adjustments properlv form ing the field of executive ordinances or decrees Nevertheless the very experience of the commission in repealing and amending its own work led it to gradually entrust certain legis 30 All the steps taken for the pacification of the Philippines and the organi zation there of government were taken under authority of the President and by virte of his constitutional powers as commanderinchief of the ary Congress gave no sanction to the Presidents work until the Philippine Bill noted above although on March 2 I9oi it did recognize American possession by a section of the army appropriation bill which ratified the customs law as enacted by the Philippine Commission and added a revenue law granting refunds to the Philip pine government of customs collected on American imports from the Philippines This law of Congress further provided that no person in the Philippine Islands should be convicted of treason  unless on the testinmony of two witnesses to the same overt act or on confession in open court  On April 29 1902 shortly be fore the enactment of the Philippine Bill an act was passed applying the Chinese immigration laws to the archipelago 31 The title of civil governor created in distinction to that of nilitary gov ernor was that held by Mr Taft After his retirement from the Philippines and appointment as Secretary of War he secured for his successor the adoption by Congress of the title governorgeneral  thereby reviving the high designation used during the last period of Spanish rule and placing the office on a parity of dignity with that of other colonial empires of first importanceGovernorGeneral of the Philzizpines 307 lative powers to the governorgeneral This process was augmented by the inauguration of the Philippine assembly As the period of its exclusive legislative authority drew to a close the commission labored diligently and with obvious purpose to bring the body of Philippine laws to a state which would not require further enact ments if legislation proved impossible with the setting up of a con current lawmaking chamber A number of acts conferred powers on the governorgeneral in explicit expectation that the legislative power would thereafter be exercised less freely For example the preamble to Act i748 recites that whereas changes in the boundaries and capital seats of provinces may be made necessary by new routes of communication and other economic development and  Whereas the Legislature will not in all probability be in session more than ninety days per annum and Whereas it is desirable that there may be provided by law an expeditious method by which such changes may be made  it is enacted that whenever in the judgment of the governorgeneral the public welfare requires he may by executive order change the boundaries or subdivide or merge any province subprovince municipality township or administrative jurisdiction and in case new offices are made necessary by subdivision create such offices and fill them either by appointment or by election Action under the powers of this act has been constant Through its exercise hundreds of towns once deprived of their autonomy have been restored to their earlier status32 An earlier act of the same character No I70I authorized the governorgeneral in the interests of economy to consolidate the office of provincial fiscal for two or more provinces and this power has also been exercised repeatedly Another remarkable power exercised for some years was con ferred by a clause in a general appropriation bill authorizing the governorgeneral to combine any two or more positions and from the united salaries to form a new position of higher grade and authorizing the appointment of two or more persons for the salary provided for a single position33 These powers were exercised by GovernorGeneral Forbes in such a manner as to arouse the opposi tion of the assembly and with the passage of the first appropriation bill under GovernorGeneral Harrison such action was made illegal34 It is doubtful from the scientific standpoint whether a power to recast budgetary provisions should ever have been conferred In a 32 See Executive Orders and Proclatations Manila I909 i90i Igii IgI2 1913 19I4 33 Act I679 sect 3 34 Act 23I9 sects 2 to 6308 D P Barrows representative government which on the legislative side that of the Philippines is the power to determine the number and grade of offices and the appropriations for specific ends is a legislative function35 Acts of the commission have frequently left to executive author ity the determination of the date when they should become opera tive For years the land tax was difficult to collect and the con tinuous petitioning of provincial boards for legislative relief from the payment of this tax was finally settled by conferring upon the governorgeneral the power to grant such suspension Act 17I3 Prior to the inauguration of the first session of the Philippine assembly the ordering and arrangement of the budget for sub mission to the legislative body was under the governorgenerals immediate control as this work was done by the executive secretary There can be little difference of opinion that this is the scientific and proper manner for budget submission American practice the faults of which are becoming obvious to the public has however confided this task to legislative committees It was particularly unfortunate that this tradition should have been so fixed in the minds of the members of the Philippine Commission as to induce them at once to relinquish this properly executive function to a com mittee of the assembly The appropriation bill passed by the first legislature was indeed better than might have been anticipated but it fell short of what an appropriation bill properly considered from the standpoint of government needs should be Owing to the in ability thereafter of commission and assembly to agree upon another appropriation it remained the regular budget during the entire administration of GovernorGeneral Forbes I909 to I9I336 The governorgeneral possesses very ample powers of granting pardons and paroles The authority seems to be descended from that exercised by the military governor Neither Congress nor the Philippine Commission ever directly bestowed it On June 2 I902 a general amnesty was extended to political prisoners in the Philip pines by the President Ordinary criminal offenders were not in cluded but the President directed that  special application may be made by those exempted from the amnesty to the proper authority 3 The action of the governorgeneral in this matter was the cause of a serious dispute between him and one of the commissioners See Congressional Record XLIX 3I053107 36 The Philippine Bill providing for the assembly required that in case of failure to pass an appropriation bill for a new budget period the former budget should continue in force with identical appropriations This device which seems to have been borrowed from the constitution of Japan and which has been ex tended also to the government of Porto Rico prevents the assembly from coercing the commission by the historic method of refusal to  grant supply Governor General of the Philippines 309 for pardon  This  proper authority is conceived to be the governorgeneral The power of pardon has been liberally used by all governorsgeneral sometimes upon the recommendation of a board of pardons appointed by the executive to review records and otherwise upon examination of applications by the governorgeneral himself Under conditions that exist in the Philippines the pardoning power is one of immense delicacy and political importance Its exercise is surrounded with difficulties Among notable cases have been the decision of GovernorGeneral Smith in the application for pardon of the cabecillas Sakay Montalon and de Vega who after surrender were condemned to death and finally executed and the recent case of General Noriel Pardon having been refused for this man application was made directly to President Wilson who granted a stay Whereupon according to reliable reports GovernorGeneral Harrison tendered his resignation The inter position of the President was then withdrawn and the execution of General Noriel followed on the day fixed Legislation has twice extended the scope of the pardoning power by authorizing condi tional pardons and paroles Acts I524 and i56i3 The power of exile and deportation once exercised by the gov ernorgeneral under Spain and by the military governor is hardly to be so easily explained and indeed seems to be irreconcilable with the constitutional system extended to the Philippines Yet without doubt the governorgeneral has this power at least as respects aliens including not merely aliens seeking admission who may without judicial review of their acts be expelled by immigration authorities but also aliens long resident in the Philippines In I9IO certain Chinese twelve in number designated by the Chinese consulgen eral as persons prejudicial to the good order of the Chinese com munity were arrested and conveyed to China by order of the governorgeneral or at least under his authority One had been for years a resident in the islands and had children in the public schools Subsequently several of the number returned and sought protec tion by a writ of injunction to police and constabulary authorities and also to the governorgeneral A suit for damages against GovernorGeneral Forbes was also filed The supreme court of the Philippines to which the cases were appealed upheld the power of the governorgeneral to deport obnoxious aliens as a power 37 The Municipal Board of Manila for a long time followed the practice of pardoning offenders convicted of violations of municipal ordinances without other warrant for such action than that such power was exercised under military rule by the provostmarshalgeneral3IO D P Barrows inherent in the executive without specific legislative grant3 Mean while the Philippine legislature passed an act defining  due process of law  in such cases to be a hearing before the governorgeneral or his authorized representative and providing further that the act should not be construed to authorize the  extrafiamiento destierro deportation or other form of expulsion from the islands of Fili pinos  Act 2II3 This case raises the general question of the power of courts to review the acts of administrative officers In the United States this is the recognized procedure It is well settled that the acts of the President of the United States are not judicially reviewable nor will the ordinary writs lie against him but this does not apply to his cabinet officers nor have the courts always applied this exemption to the governor of a state We have seen that the Manila court directed a writ of injunction to the governorgeneral But in the main the action of courts for reviewing administrative acts for determining conflicts of jurisdiction or for interpreting administrative powers has been extremely sparse In place of judicial action the commission has existed to adjust or determine by executive instruction or new legislation any conflict of powers and to redress by direct action any abusive or unwise conduct of a subordinate officer Aggrieved persons have found this method of redress so advantageous that there has existed practically no induce ment to appeal to the courts The commission has in fact acted in certain cases almost as an  administrative court  in the Continental sense But the informality of its proceedings and the absence of record have delayed the growth of anything like a body of  admin istrative law The situation is one to suggest the establishment under the governorgeneral of a superior administrative court in the proper sense to hear cases and recommend action in a large class of responsibilities in respect to which the governorgeneral has been entrusted with an administrativejudicial power These cases in clude review of disputed elections charges of malfeasance and removal from office disqualification from holding public office decisions on appeal from provincial boards on the legality of munic ipal ordinances the reservation of public lands the fixing of penal stations and the determination of responsibility for loss of property by officials with consequent deductions of salary Such cases as these and many others which are within the governorgenerals competence and which are frequently decided on merely clerical 38 Forbes et al v Tiaco et al i6 Philippine Reports 534 This decision on somewhat different grounds has been upheld by the United States Supreme Court Tiaco v Forbes 228 U S 549Governor General of the Philizppines 3II advice are quasijudicial in character and could presumably be settled with greater wisdom if action were taken under the advice of a body or court composed of men highly trained in both admin istration and law To return finally to the dilemma with which this paper opened there seems to be no escape in the government of such a dependency as the Philippines from entrusting great powers to a single man and granting him a confidence which cannot easily be weakened by detraction The practical restraints on such a position seem to be only two an informed public opinion and watchful interest on the part of a considerable element in the sovereign nationsuch atten tion for example as the Dutch people give to their immense empire of NetherlandsIndiaand secondly the restraint and patience that is produced in a chief executive by a long service in similar capacities In the government of colonies nothing can take the place of this experience Colonial affairs and administration differ in so many important respects from domestic politics that experience in the latter is no guaranty of success in the former Every country except our own has come to the policy of making training and ex perience the indispensable prerequisites for high executive discretion in colonial government The history of the Philippines under both Spain and America is sufficient to demonstrate them indispensable to the office of the governorgeneral DAVID P BARROWS

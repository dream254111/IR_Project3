j100011,Biological Bulletin,1536270,Some Cryoscopic and Osmotic Data,i268344,SOME CRYOSCOPIC AND OSMOTIC DATA1 WALTER E GARREY Subsequent to the publication in I905 of data on The Osmotic Pressure of Sea Water and the Blood of Marine Animals etc I the author has had occasion in the course of his other investiga tions to make numerous determinations of the freezing point of various sea waters solutions and bloods this method having been used to check up other methods of obtaining solutions of known osmotic pressures Some of the data thus acquired have been correlated and although somewhat fragmentary they are published in hopes that they may facilitate the work of other biologists The determinations have been made with the Beckmann apparatus and a differential thermometer which could be read accurately to 0005 C When it is remembered that the de pression of the freezing point A of a grammolecular solution of a nonelectrolyte is theoretically at least 185 C below zero that this depression corresponds with an osmotic pressure of 224 atmospheres at o C and that the osmotic pressures vary di rectly with the depression of the freezing point it is seen that the osmotic pressure of any solution may be calculated from the simple formula osmotic pressure 224 a AI85 SEA WATERS Sea waters are not solutions of absolutely fixed chemical com position nor have they a constant concentration While the ratios of certain salts are quite constant there are other variations such as the content of absorbed oxygen and carbon dioxide and even of the fixed carbonates J Loeb 2 has called attention to the fact that the free alkalinity i e the number of HO ions is distinctly higher in the sea water at Woods Hole than at Pacific Grove From the Physiological Laboratory of Washington University St Louis 77WALTER E GARREY The figures for the depression of the freezing point A given in Table I indicate the wide range in concentrations in sea waters of different localities

Magnesium chloride 029 m cane sugar 073 m Vant Hoffs solution made from m2 stock solutions had a freezing point of  184 C this is so slightly in excess of the concentration of Woods Hole sea water

minations of the Pacific Grove sea water and found that A  1924 C Garrey in I905 made determinations obtaining a slightly lower value for A viz I905 C On the basis of either of these figures it is seen that the sea water in this locality is about 5 per cent more concentrated than at Woods Hole and that a correction for this amount must be made if the osmotically equivalent solutions are to be calculated from the figures given in the previous section a c Beaufort N CWorking in the laboratories of the U S Bureau of Fisheries during the summer of I911 the author made the following observations of the freezing point of sea water obtained at different localities in that vicinity and under different conditions as described in Table II TABLE II I9II Beaufort N C A  C Remarks June 8

in biological investigations on marine forms of diluted sea water and corresponding concentrations of pure salts has led the author to make the determinations found in Table III Various dilutions of Woods Hole sea water were made and the freezing points determined In most cases the densities at these dilutions have also been determined by the pycnometer method The figures given in the table are all from actual determinations made 79WALTER E GARREY by the author when not given they may be approximated by interpolation1 TABLE III Dilution Densities of Sea NaCl with same A Woods Hole Distilled

Attention should be directed to a fact to which Jones 4 Morse and Fraser and Berkeley and Hartley have called atten tion viz that cane sugar solutions show osmotic pressures considerably in excess of what theory would lead one to expect Loeb has shown the importance of this fact for biological work 5 From purely theoretical considerations one would expect a molar grammolecular solution to show an osmotic pressure only slightly in excess of that of Woods Hole sea water Loeb found that it caused a shrinkage of the eggs of the echinoderms even of the Pacific and his experiments caused him to select 68 m cane sugar as the proper concentration for the development of Stron gylocentrotus purpuratus The osmotic pressure of Woods Hole sea water by calculation from the freezing point is 219 a at o C a figure which is almost identical with that obtained by 1 The determinations of Gerlach for NaCl and KC1 ChemikerKalender I914 I p 26I and of Schiff for MgCl and CaC12 ibid p 265 show that for concentra tions of solutions of the magnitudes with which we are dealing and in which these salts are present in sea water the densities are a linear function of the concentration A plat of our determinations shows the same to be true for both densities and freezing points of dilutions of sea water 80CRYOSCOPIC AND OSMOTIC DATA calculation for 075 gram molecular solutions of cane sugar using the measurements of Berkeley and Hartley1 Some of our de terminations of the freezing point of solutions of cane sugar illustrate their peculiar osmotic behavior2 For a gram molecular solution of cane sugar 3422 grams per liter of solution we found A   2775 C for 4 mol 2566 grams per liter A   1855  186 C and for f mol 1711 grams per liter A   115  ii55 C For these three solutions the theoretical depression of the freezing point would be to  185  1387 and  0925 C respectively Comparison of these figures shows how much in excess of the theoretical osmotic pressure that of these solutions really is Morse and Fraser have pointed out that the correspondence with the theoretical expectations is greater if weight normal solutions are used i e if the substance is present in a liter of the solvent instead of this volume of the solution This does not account however for the full amount of the discrepancy found To illustrate this It was found in our experiments that in making a grammolecular solution by dissolving 1711 grams of cane sugar in 50 cc of the solution I5 C it was necessary to add only 394 cc of distilled water A was  2775 C Had 50 cc of solvent been used to make the corresponding weight normal solution A would have been  2187 C3 This figure exceeds the theoretical A  185 C by 0337 C which is probably to be accounted for by hydration of the sucrose molecule Callendar 6 In the figures given above it is to be noted that the A of 75 mol solution of sucrose  1855 C is that which theory expects of a gram molecular solution and its osmotic pressure lies between that of the sea water at Woods Hole and Pacific Grove By 1 The measurements of Berkeley and Hartley were made using other concen trations The original figures of these workers as also those of Morse and Fraser et al are given in the  Physikalischchemische Tabellen Landolt Bbrnstein and Roth 4th ed Table I79 p 787 Their original papers are referred to ibid p 790 2 The sugar used in these

OSMOTIC DATA to either side of those isosmotic with the sea waters of our coast laboratories b Magnesium ChlorideIn solutions of this salt some of the molecules are dissociated into three ions which accounts for the fact that the osmotic pressure is greater and consequently the depression of the freezing point is lower than that of equi molecular solutions of sodium chloride The following commonly employed solutions have been tested cf Table V ANIMALS In addition to data previously published by the author loc cit p 263 several determinations have been made on the blood of animals of the waters of the American coast and inland rivers a Limulus polyphemusIn the work referred to it was shown that under experimental conditions the blood of this animal like that of other marine invertebrates varies to conform in concentration to that of the external medium We have since found that this is true in the natural habitat of these ani mals thus at Woods Hole I904 the blood of Limuli depressed the freezing point like sea water to  182 C At Beaufort N C July 20 I9II the water of the Fisheries pound froze at  203 C The blood of four Limuli taken from this water in which they had been kept for several weeks showed the fol lowing freezing points respectively  2025  203  204 and  235 C In the case of another Limulus captured at Cross Rocks in the Newport River near Beaufort September 8 I9II the blood A   17I C while the water at that place depressed the freezing point to  1707 C Such readings taken from animals under natural conditions established the absolute identity of osmotic pressure of the external and internal media despite the differences in their composition b ElasmobranchsA shark seven feet in length not identi fied was captured in the Fish Commission nets at Beaufort July 27 1911 the sea water froze at  202 C cryoscopic readings of the blood from the heart and portal vein withdrawn immediately after death were identical within oo1 C and showed A to be  2182 C which again is practically identical with that of the Beaufort sea water taken in the neighborhood of the fish trap on that date 83WALTER E GARREY The A for this elasmobranch is larger than for those tested at Woods Hole by the author and later by Scott 7 The figures indicate an adjustment to the greater concentration of the sea water at Beaufort a fact which is also borne out by determina tions made on the blood of sting rays the blood of four of which at Beaufort gave A   198  204  203  207 C respectively These depressions are not greater than that of the sea water from which the animals were taken although both the author and Scott found a slightly greater depression for the blood of the dog fish Mustelus canis of Woods Hole than for the sea water of the laboratories this water is however somewhat less concentrated than the water outside the heads c Marine turtlesThe defibrinated blood of three species of marine turtlesl caught at Beaufort in I911 was frozen and the A thus determined for each individual is as follows Chelonia mydas A   0675 C Colpochelys kempi A   0687  0700  070 C Caretta caretta A   0690  0690  0685 C In the cases of two carettas obtained at Woods Hole in 1913 the A found was identical with that given above These depressions A are in all cases greater than those obtained by Bottazzi for Thalassochelys caretta A   o6I although it is worthy of mention that the waters from which our animals were taken were if one can judge from Bottazzis writings less con centrated than that from which his specimens were obtained if any adjustment to aqueous media were to take place it would be in the direction opposite to that indicated by the above figure It is certainly true however that the blood of fresh water and land turtles shows a depression of the freezing point which is distinctly less than that of marine turtles Bottazzi found A for Emys europa   0463 to  0485 C while for Pseudemys elegans of the Mississippi Valley we obtained a depression in which A   048 C These figures are so much below those obtained with the blood of marine turtles that they would seem to indicate the possibility of some degree of adjustment to the concentration of the external medium on the other hand it is a 1 The author is indebted to Mr Hay for the identification of these animals 84CRYOSCOPIC AND OSMOTIC DATA fact that the land turtles do not show a more concentrated blood than do those which live mainly in fresh water This point was put to the experimental test upon the marine turtles Colpochelys kempi and Caretta caretta the last figure in the previous data given above for each of these species was ob tained with the blood of a specimen which had been kept for two months in a tank containing fresh water There was ab solutely no change in the concentration of the blood of these individuals and we feel justified in concluding that adjustments of the nature of those under consideration do not take place in these forms at least not within the duration of our experiments d Fresh Water FishPreliminary to a study of the effects of osmotic and saline media upon fresh water fish soon forth coming it was desirable to know the osmotic pressure of the blood of forms taken from the Mississippi river The following list contains some forms peculiar to this region on which no data have hitherto been given I Polyodon spathula   0492  0486  050 C 2 Scaphirhynchus platyrhynchus   0505  0507  0503 C 3 Lepidosteus osseous L Gar   0487 to  052 C 4 Amia calva L land locked   0508 C 5 Catostomus teres   051 to  0520 C 6 Perca fuviatilis   04980 to  05I C Fresh water ganoids are seen to have blood which is identical in concentration with that of fresh water teleosts All have blood less concentrated than that of any df the marine fishes and it is conceivable that in the case of these animals some adjustment to environment has taken place such adjustments are known for marine fish as has been shown by the author I

seem to be sufficient to constitute a legal ground for an accusation of petit larceny by the bailee Whether or not the felonious intent existed is a question of fact for the jury upon the trial of the accusation BILLS AND NOTESCARRIERSBANK DISCOUNTING A DRAFT WITH A BILL OF LADING ATTACHED NOT LIABLE FOR BREACH OF SELLERS CONTRACTA draft with bill of lading attached drawn by a seller on the buyer for fruit shipped was discounted by a bank The buyer who is plaintiff in this action accepted and paid the draft before examining the fruit which upon examination was found defective Whereupon the buyer claimed misrepresentation and breach of warranty and brought action against seller and the bank contending the bank was substituted by the acts of the parties for the original contracting party and being in this position was in equity bound to refund moneys collected on the draft as improperly held by it Held the bank is not liable Williams v National Fruit Exchange Conn 111 Atl 197 There is no question but that a contracting party is liable for breach of warranty The question here is how far the bank is responsible as a contracting party and what is its relation to the drawee of the draft The courts of Alabama Mississippi Texas and North Carolina have held that a bank discounting a draft with a bill of lading attached is bound to refund the money collected on it to the drawee of the same when the goods are not as represented in the bill of lading and the drawee has had no opportuity to examine them before he paid the draft Haas v Citizens Bank 144 Ala 562 39 So 129 1 L R A N

492 62 So 625 though with strong dissent The Mississippi case Searles v Smith Grain Co supra rested solely upon Landa v Lattin supra which as seen has now been overruled and the later Mississippi Cases simply cited and followed the first one There are many cases holding the bank not liable and they hold this on two separate grounds Of these cases the majority hold the bank does not hold the money paid to it by the drawee of the draft improperly as the bank is an innocent purchaser for value of the draft and by the law merchant is not liable even if the consideration between the drawer and drawee fail entirely They further hold there is no condition in the drawees acceptance of the draft that the goods shall correspond to the bill of lading but that his acceptance is absolute with regard to an innocent purchaser for value of the draft Central Mer cantile Co v Oklahoma State Bank 83 Kan 504 112 Pac 114 33 L R A N S 954 Springs v Hanover National Bank 209 N Y 224 103 N E 156 52 L R A N S 241 Guaranty Trust Co v Hannay 210 Fed 810 Cosmos Cotton Co v First National Bank supra Goetz v Bank of Kansas City 119 U S 551 In the second line of authority this doctrine of the law merchant seems not to be disputed The plaintiffs claim in these cases is that the assignment of the bill of lading to the bank is absolute and not as mere security for the draft that it is an assignment to the bank of the sellers contract If this be the case then of course the bank takes the bill of lading subject to any equities existing against the seller Munson v De Tamble Motors Co 88 Conn 415 91 Atl 531 L R A 1915A 881 But in the absence of express stipulations to that effect such is not the usual course of business The bank does not generally take an absolute title to the bill of lading but only a special property in it until the draft is satisfied They hold it only as a pledgee Hawkins v Alfalfa Products Co 152 Ky 152 153 S W 201 44 L R A N S 600 Mason v Nelson supra Douglas

exception of the Mississippi cases the authorities cited above show that in the usual course of business there is never but one contract relation between the bank and the drawee and that is the contract that is made when the drawee accepts the draft This is their only contract and this is discharged when the draft is paid Hawkins v Alfalfa Products Co supra CRIMINAL LAWSUICIDEADMINISTERING

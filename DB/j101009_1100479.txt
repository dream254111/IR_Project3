electric car could have been stopped in a given case should be based upon the operation of cars of similar construction and equipment and under like conditions 2 STREET RAILWAYsTrespassers on trackDuty toCase at bar A street car company owes no duty of foresight to a trespasser on its track but only reasonable care to avoid injury after the danger is discovered In the case at bar the deceased met her death while crawling over a long trestle on defendants track on a dark night In shutting off the current to reduce the speed in going on the trestle the headlight of the car was extinguished and when it was again turned oil the deceased was for the first time discovered by the motorman so close in front of hiis car that he was unable to stop before striking her although he

by the negligence of the defendant The circumstances under which the plaintiffls intestate lost her life are as follows On the afternoon of March 2 1902 she accompanied by her daughter about 13 years of age and two other small colored girls walked out from her home in the city of Richmond to look at the higlh water in the river and in returning lhome they were diverted from their route by boys throwing stones at them and wandered away into the county of Henrico and got lost About dark they found themselves upon the county road leading from Richmond City to Seven Pines in the county of Henrico upon which the defendants track is laid and on which it operates electric cars for the transportation of passengers between Richmond City and Seven Pines and they undertook to follow this road back to Richmond After going a short distance the party discovered some one with a lamp near the road and called to him to know the way they should go in order to reach Richmond and were told to follow that road that will put you to Richmond or to keep the county road and go straight ahead A short way from where these instructions were received the county road deflects to the north for the purpose of crossing a stream that has high banks directly in front of the place or deflection whilst the electric railroad runs straight along and crosses the stream upon a trestle which is about 60 feet high and 415 feet long This trestle has no walkway upon it but a person crossing it must step from joist to joist the joists being about 18 inches apart with nothing between them or under the spaces be tween them and there is not room enough on either side of the railwav track for a person to stand while one of the defendants electric cars is passing Upon reaching the point where the county roal and railway track separate the deceased with the little girls accompanying her followed the railway track and upon reaching the trestle and finding that they could not walk across it they got oln their knees and hands and attempted to make their passage over it by crawling from joist to joist and when theyl had gotten be yonad the nuiddle of the trestle one of the defendants electric cars on its return from Seven Pines to Richmond ran upon andl over them killing the deceased Frances Rackss at a point about 65 feet froin the western end of the trestle The approaclh of the railway track from the cast of the trestle is1903 RICHMOND PASSENGER ETC CO V RACKS 327 on a down grade while the trestle itself is level and upon ap proaching the trestle the current of electricity is turned off and the car allowed to roll of its own motion until it reaches about mid way of the trestle when the current is gradually turned on again to restore sufficient speed to ascend the grade beginning at the west end of the trestle It is not controverted that under these circumstances the de ceased was a trespasser and no duty was owing to her by the de fendant except after it knew of her danger and peril to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring her and therefore the only ques tion in tIhe case is whether or not the motorman in charge of the car did all that he could do in the exercise of reasonable care to stop his car after he discovered her peril The undisputed facts proved are that the car of the defendant company which ran upon the deceased is about 42 feet long that the night of the accident was very dark and very dampalmost raining and that by reason of the dampness the track was in the very worst of all conditions for stopping the car With the view of proving the distance within which the car might have been stopped the plaintiff introduced several expert witnessesamong them T E Felt superintendent of the Rich mond  Petersburg Electric Railway Company who testified in regard to stopping the cars on his road and when recalled a second time for examination he was permitted in answer to a question ly paintiffs counsel over the objection of the defendant to state that when the current of electricity has stopped the wheels of one of his cars from revolving or the wheels are made to reverse so that the car is moving only by its own mnomentulmi it would stop in 40 feet Evidence having been introduced as to the construction and equiplmient of the cars of the defendant operated on the Seven Pines Road showing that they had entirely different machinery from the iiiachinerv of the cars on the Richmond  Petersburg Electric Railway as described by the witness Felt and that no com parison could properly be made between the equipment or appli ances upon the cars operated upon the respective roads the defend ants moved the court to exclude the testilmiony of Felt as to stopping cars whichl motion was overruled anl this ruling is mliade the foundation of the defencalnts first bill of exceptions The court is of opinion that this exception is well takeni No foundation lhad been laid for the testimony of the witness objected328 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug to by showing similarity between the ears of which he was speaking and the car involved in the accident out of which this suit arises Qn the contrary it had not only been shown that the cars were dis similar but that the circumstances existing at the time of the accident were different from those under which the witness testified as to stopping cars on his road Testimony as to what could be done to avoid injury to a person on an electric car track with dif ferent cars differently equipped and under different conditions instead of being helpful to the jury in reaching a right conelision as to whether the motorman in charge of the car in question negli gently failed to do all in his power to avoid injury to the deceased after he discovered her peril was well calculated to lead them away from the pertinent and relevant testimony in the case into the field of conjecture which as has often been repeated cannot be per mitted An inference cannot be drawn from a presumption but must be founlded upon some fact legally established N  ITT Ry Co v Cromer 99 Va 794 40 S E 54 The two remaining exceptions taken by the defendant may be con sidered together The one relates to the giving of an instruction asked by the plaintiff and the other to the refusal of the court to award a new trial on the ground that the verdict is contrary to the law and the evidence The instruction referred to and the only instruction given for the plaintiff is as follows The jury are instructed that if they believe from the evidence that the motorman in charge of the defendants car on the evening of March 2 1902 could by the exercise of ordinary care have prevented said car from running on the deceased after he saw her that they are instructed that it was his duty to pre vent said car from running on the deceased and if they believe further from the evidence that he neglected said duty and that the death of deceased was due to such neglect of duty the defendant is liable for such neglect of duty and in that case their verdict should be for the plaintiff It is not claimed that the instruction propounds an incorrect proposition of law but the contention is that there was not suffi cient evidence to warrant the court in giving it We do not deem it necessary to consider this contention as we are called upon to determine whether or not the evidence is sufficient to sustain the verdict of the jury The first witness for the plaintiff was R A Powell the inotor man of the car He testified that he was not certain as to where he1903 RICHMOND PASSENGER ETC CO V RACKS 329 was when he first saw these people on the trestle it washard to tell in the dark and he could not be positive But he explains that in order to reduce the speed of the car when entering upon the trestle so as to go upon it at a low rate of speed the current of electricity is cut off which so reduces the headlight that nothing could be seen in front until the current was put on again when the headlight is revived that as was usual the current had been cut off and he began to feed his car up by applying the electricity about the center of the trestle or when he supposed he was about the center and it takes some time to feed it up to nine points needed to ascend the grade beginning at the west end of the trestle that he had fed it up to nine points and was running on nine points when he first saw these people He thereby explains that he was several car lengths past the center of the trestle when he saw them and instantly applied his brake reversed his current and made the best stop he could using all the means inhis power to prevent the accident In answer to the question There is no guessing on your part that instantly you saw those people you tried to stop the car in every way you could he witness said I did in every way I could to prevent the accident I dont believe a man ever worked on a car more faithfully than I did trying to stop it The car as we have observed was about 42 feet long and the de ceased was run over 65 feet from the western end of the trestle that is about 142 feet from the middle of the trestle approaching from the east The witness was not asked how close he thought he was to those people when hefirst saw them nor as to how far the car ran beyond the point of the accident before it stopped but from the explanation be makes as to how he handled the car that the headlight would only light the trestle in front about 40 feet when feeding the car up if he had run as he stated 212 car lengths past the middle of the trestle while feeding the car up the only inference that could have been drawn was that he was in less than 40 feet of the people when he first saw them The statement of the witness of the defendant 1J V Mayor who was a passenger standing by the motorman Powell in no way conflicts with the latters testimony but corroborates the statement he made that the car was too close when the people were seen to be stopped in time to avoid running over them Mayor says that the reversing of the car attracted his attention and looking forward he saw the people about 40 feet off330 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug Another witness for the defendant who was a passenger on the car and standing niear the motorman also corroborates the latter in the statement that he did everything in his power to stop the car before reaching these people Plaintiffs witness R W Jennings testified that a car rulnninQ eight miles ail hour the supposed speed of the car at the tinme of this accident on a dead level and a dry rail could be stopped in 40 feet on a wet rail with the use of sand it would take only five feet further but if you did not have sand it would take 10 feet more maybe longer than that He could not tell however about a slick railas was the case herehow long it would take to stop the car and he concurs in the statemelnt of other witnesses that the current of electricity cannot be reversed so as to bring the wheels to a dead stop or mak them go back instantly as it takes it at least two seconds to give it time to get in that is to take hold and have effect Annie Racks the 13 year old daughter of the deceased as a wit ness for the plaintiff testifies that the light on the car went oiut just as the car reached the eastern end of the trestle and that the light came on no more until the accident was over and the car had gotten across the trestle She as stated by all the other witnesses says that it was a dark night and in this darkness while she was crawling uporn her hands and knees over the trestle she claims that slhe saw the motorman turning all around the brakes meaning dloubtless turning the brakes around when the car was the dis tance of the width of Broad street from her that the light did not go out until the car was as close to her as across Broad street anl that they were then about the middle of the trestle It appears that the witness saved her life by swinging under the trestle at the point where her mother was killed while one of the remaining two of the party jumped off the trestle and the other was knocked off and all this occurred at a point as we have seen 65 feet from the westcrn end of the trestle and at least 142 feet west of its center so that in the very nature things as well as by the plaintiffs other evidence in the case it is impossible that this witness state ment that the lights on the car went out as it entered upon the east end of the trestl  and never came on again until it had passed over the trestle can be true But if the statement be accepted as true it neither proves as a fact nor warrants the inference that the motor man in charge of the car failed to do as he states he did all in his1903 DANVILLE V HATCHER 331 power to stop his car after he discovered these people on the trestle On the contrary the plaintiffs other evidence conclusively proves that if the statement of Annie Racks be truethat the lights on the car went out as it entered upon the east end of the trestle and re mained out until it passed entirely over itit was impossible that the motorman could have at any time seen these people on the trestle before running over them It is not pretended that he saw them from the east end of the trestle where as Annie Racks claims the light went out and never came on again for if such were the case he wantonly or recklessly ran his car upon them and it is conceded by counsel in argument here that such was not the case the contention being only that when the motorman saw the de ceaseds peril he became so awestricken that he lost ability to deal effectually with the situation Subjecting the whole evidence to the most rigid application of the rule governing demurrers to evidence no other conclusion could rightly be reached than that the death of the deceased was due solely to her own reckless intrusion upon the defendants trestle and right of way as a trespasser It follows that the judgment of the lower court refusing to set aside the verdict of the jury and award the defendant a new trial must be reversed and annulled and the cause remanded Reversed

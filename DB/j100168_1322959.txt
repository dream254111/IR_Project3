book in the defendant bank together with a power of attorney to deposit and draw money After her death but before the defendant learned of her death the defendant made payments to the agent There was no evidence of an intention on the part of the intestate to make a gift or pledge to the agent Held that the bank is liable for the amount paid over as the power of the agent was not coupled with an interest and was therefore terminated by the death of the prin cipal Hofqfnan Administrator v Union Dime Savinzgs Institutiorn IO9 N Y App Div 24 See NOTES P 287 AGENCY UNDISCLOSED PRINCIPALS RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PERSONS  OFFER TO CONTRZACT ADOPTED BY UNDISCLOSED PRINCIPAL BEFORE ACCEPTANCE  A in his own name made an offer to sell a certain crane to the defendant The plaintiff then purchased the crane and authorized A to proceed with the transaction as his agent The defendant afterwards accepted the offer Held that the plaintiff cannot sue the defendant on the contract Mooney v Williams 5 N S W 304 When a simple contract is made by a person acting as agent for an undis closed principal that principal may in certain cases be sued and sue on the contract in his own name Paterson v Ganbaseqiu I5 East 62 Simns v Bond 5 B  Ad 389 The true basis of this anomalous doctrine seems to be that although the contracting party is really the agent yet the relations existing de facto between the agent and his principal render it just that under certain circumstances the principal be allowed to sue and be sued as if he were the real contracting party See Railton v Hodgson 4 Taunt 576 577 note Otherwise the recognized exceptions to an undisclosed principals liability are wholly illogical See STORY AGENCY gth ed  449 But the agency must at the very latest exist when the contract is closed Subsequent ratification will not suffice where the agent purports to act as principal Keigkly etc Co v Dzeranit I90I A C 240 It seems however that this relationship need not be contemporaneous with the express offer The offeree theoretically accepts that offer which he has reasonably been led to believe the offerer is making to him at the moment of his acceptance the offer being regarded as continuing till this time But at this moment when the theoretical offer is made and accepted the offerer is agent The principal may therefore have the right to sue Practically it is an undesirable formality to require the withdrawal of an offer merely to repeat it immediately in identical language after the offerer has become agent for the undisclosed principalRECENVT CASES 297 ALIENS  WHETHER A STATE COURT MAY VACATE ITS DECREE OF NATURALIZATION ON ACCOUNT OF FRAUD A county court of a state granted to the plaintiff in error an alien a certificate admitting him to United States citizenship This certificate was obtained by a fraudulent representation of the applicant The county attorney as officer of this court petitioned on this ground to have the certificate set aside Held that the petition cannot be granted Peterson v State 89 S WV Rep 8I Tex Civ App The power to naturalize is vested by the Constitution in Congress but this power has been conferred by statute upon certain state courts U S Rev St  2165 Such courts when engaged in admitting aliens to citizenship are re garded like true federal courts as agents of the United States government Re Christern 43 N Y Sup Ct 523 Peofie v Sweetman 3 Park Cr Rep N Y 358 The decrees of naturalization granted by these agent courts have the force and effect of judgments Sfiratt v Sfratt 4 Pet U S 393 As in the case of other judgments however the rule is that they may if obtained by fraud be set aside at the instigation of the defrauded party United States v Norsch 42 Fed Rep 417 In the present case it is clear that tlle United States was a party to the original judgment through the medium of the county court But the question remains did it continue a party to the petition by the county attorney as agent for such court  If so the above rule permitting judgments to be set aside on the ground of fraud would apply The court in answering this question in the negative reads strictly according to the ordinary rule of statutory interpretation the statute delegating to county courts the power of natu ralization But it has been held that a United States circuit court has power to set aside a similar decree if obtained by fraud and it may be doubted whether the statute did not intend to grant the same power to the county court See Pintsch Cornjfressing Co v Bergin 84 Fed Rep I40 BANKRUPTCY DISCHARGE  LIABILITIES FOR SUPPORT OF WIFE OR CHILD The Act of February 5 1903 amendatory to the National Bankruptcy Act of July I I898 provided that a discharge in bankruptcy should release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts except such as are liabilities    for maintenance or support of wife or child U S Comp St Supp 1903 41I Held that this excepting clause does not apply to a debt incurred for the services of a physician called by the husband to attend the wife In re Ostrander 139 Fed Rep 592 Dist Ct E D N Y Under the Act of 1898 by the weight of authority liabilities incident to sup port or bastardy orders were not dischargeable in bankruptcy Zn re Baker 96 Fed Rep 954 Wenore v Markoe I96 U S 68 Nor was a bankrupts debt arising out of an express contract to support hiis children discharged Dun bar v Du5zbar I90 U S 340 Liabilities therefore in the nature of direct enforcements of the common law duty to support wife and child were excepted from discharge but not those contractual obligations incidentally incurred in the performance of that duty The excepting clause of the Act of I903 can scarcely apply to this latter form of liabilities as such a construction would exempt all debts for family necessaries from discharge in bankruptcy a result clearly not intended The clause therefore seems to be simply declaratory of the meaning of the Act of I898 as previously interpreted by the courts and has been so regarded See Wemore v AMarkoe sufra The case at hand by its decision and dicum confines the clause in question to those direct liabilities entailed by nonperformance of the common law duty to support wife and child and seems sound in its conclusion BANKRUPTCY PREFERENCES  PERFECTING INCHOATE RIGHT TO SE CU RITY  The defendant who held mortgages on the real estate of a bankrupt which had been executed in good faith for contemporaneous loans of monev had them recorded within four months of the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings By the law of

LAW  PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES RIGHT TO ACT AS EXECUTOR Held that a legislative enactment that no nonresident shall be appointed or act as executor  is not a violation of U S Const Art 4  2 which provides that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states In re AYVuford 75 N E Rep 345 Ill The Supreme Court of the United States has consistently refused to define these privileges and immunities or to describe them in general classifi cations See McCready v Virginia 94 U S 391 395 Yet Mr Justice Washingtons opinion that the constitutional provision extends only to  those privileges and immunities which are in their nature fundamental which belong of right to the citizens of all free governments seems not to have been disap proved See Corfield v Coryell 4 Wash U S C C 371 380 Thus rights of a civil rather than of a political character are here protected Accordingly there would not be included the right to hold public office or even to occupy positions of a public nature See Austin v The State IO Mo 591 592 I Mich L Rev 292298 As the court in the principal case clearly points out an exec utor is a public or

TESTIMONY A state stat ute known as the Kansas AntiTrust Act compelled witnesses to testify in regard to violations of that statute and provided that neither should they be liable to criminal prosecutions for any violations of the act about which they tes tify nor should their evidence be used against them in any criminal proceedings Held that the statute is not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment which provides 1 Nor shall any state deprive any person of    liberty    without due process of law Two justices dissented Jack v State of Kansas U S Sup Ct Nov 27 1905 The state statute could not of course prevent the testimony of a witness in state proceedings from being used against him in federal courts for violations of federal statutes For the purposes of this case the court assumes that if the statute failed to give sufficient immunity from prosecution or punishment  to the witness it would violate the Fourteenth Amendment The decision is then reached on the basis that the danger of such prosecution in the federal courts is so  unsubstantial and remote that it is of no consequence that the statute does not provide against it This decision is in harmony with the same courts opinion in a previous case that although a federal statute obliging wit nesses to testify secured themn no immunity in state courts yet it did not compel s2lfincrimination within the terms of the Fifth Amendment Brown v Walker i61 U S 591 6o8 see ro HARv L REV 120 These two cases seem to establish the law that the legal immunity is in regard to a prosecution in the same jurisdiction and

an annual salary Without further express agreement the plaintiff continued in As employ for several years but was discharged in the middle of the year without cause when A became bankrupt The plaintiff therefore brings this action against As assignee in bankruptcy Held that the plaintiff had a vearly contract with A which entitles him to recover from the defendant for his discharge by A in the middle of the year without cause Baker v D Afifileton  Co 95 N Y Supp 125 The question in this case is essentially one of fact did the parties renew the agreement There was no express renewal but acts may show as unequiv ocally as words a mutual intent to be bound Where the facts as to a contract are not in dispute their interpretation is a question of fact for the court not for the jury Chicago Cheese Co v Fogg 53 Fed Rep 72 When one enters the employ of another under a contract for a years service at an annual salarv and continues in the employment after the expiration of the year the weight of au thority seems to be that this raises a presumption of fact that the parties lhave assented to a renewal of the agreement Adams v Fitzf5atrick 125 N Y 124 N H Iron Factory Co v Richardson 5 N H 294 This presumption of fact if not rebutted will sustain the conclusion that as a matter of law there was such a contract Taylor v City of Lambertville 43 N J Eq I07 And this contract is not open to objection under the Statute of Frauds Tatterson v Suffolk Manufacturing Co IO6 Mass 56 CRIMINAL LAW  FORMER JEOPARDY  CONVICTION OF HIGHER OFFENSE ON SECOND TRIAL  On a charge of murder in the first degree the plaintiffs were convicted of assault by a court of first instance of the Philippine Islands On appeal to the Supreme Court of those islands the judgment was reversed and the plaintiffs were convicted of murder in the second degree Held that the later conviction is not a violation of a legislative provision against double jeopardy Three justices dissented Trono v United States U S Sup Ct Dec 4 1905 The case is of especial interest as being the first decision by the Supreme Court of the United States upon this point concerning which the state courts are at variance But see Untited States v Harding 26 Fed Cas 131 It is well settled that an appeal by the accused operates as a waiver of the plea of former jeopardy on a second trial United States v Ball 163 U S 662 The conflict of authority arises as to the extent of such waiver See WHARTON CRIM PLEAD gth ed  465 The weight of authority is opposed to the decision in question and regards the accused as waiving the plea of former jeopardy only as to that part of the judgment which convicts him of guilt People v Gordon 99 Cal 227 contra State v Bradley 67 Vt 465 To hold that the plea is also waived as to the acquittal of any higher grades of crime included in the indictment would clearly seem to subject the accused to double jeopardy without his consent and so to violate any provision against such double jeopardy While the effect of this decision will undoubtedly be to do away with many appeals on petty grounds it will also tend to discourage those that are bonaide ELEVATORS  OPERATORS AS CARRIERS  DEGREE OF CARE  The plaintiff an employee of a tenant of the defendant was injured by the falling of an elevator which the defendant maintained and operated and brought action for damages At the trial the judge refused to instruct that the defendant was not liable if he had used reasonable care and prudence in the construction maintenance and operation of the elevator Held that it was error to re fuse such an instruction Edwards v Manufacturers Bldg Co 6i Atl Rep 646 R I It is universally held that a common carrier must exercise a high degree of care Readhead v The Mfidland Ry Co L R 2 Q B 412 An operator of an elevator is not a common carrier in the strict legal sense of the term Seaver v Bradley 179 Mass 329 But the overwhelming weight of authority is that he owes the samne degree of care as a common carrier Treadwellv Whittier 80 Cal 574 contra Grifin v Manice i66 N Y i88 The argument in theRECENT CASES 301 case under discussion is that common carriers must exercise great care because of the peculiar business in which they are engaged but that the care required of elevator operators should be only that which is due to persons on premises by implied invitation But the idea running through all the cases of common carriers and elevators alike is that public policy demands a high degree of care where so many lives are exposed to danger 7he Philadelphia etc Rd Co v Derby I4 How U S 468 486 Sfiringer v Ford I89 Ill 430 The force of this argument makes the decision of the lower court seem preferable EQUITY  INJUNCTION  CONTRACT IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE  Certain insurance companies entered into an agreement the object of which was to regulate the rates of insurance The Attorney General sought in behalf of the public to restrain them from carrying out the agreement Held that in the absence of a statute authorizing the Attorney General to bring the com plaint the bill must be dismissed although the contract was contrary to public policy being in restraint of trade McCarter Atty Gen v Firemens Ins Co 6i Atl Rep 705 N J Ch In New Jersey there is no statute prohibiting contracts in restraint of trade Nor do such contracts appear to be positively illegal though they are not enforceable at the instance of either party Cf Albright v Teas IO Stew N J 171 It is true that equity in many cases has enjoined a clear violation of the rights of the public at the instance of the Attorney General although he had no express authority by statute to bring the bill In re Debs 158 U S 564 AttorneyGeneral v Hunzter I Dev Eq N C I 2 But in general if the plaintiffs right or the defendants wrong is doubtful a permanent injunction will not issue Consolidated Canal Co v AMesa Canal Co 177 U S 296 In New Jersey at least the defendants wrong seems doubtful it lies entirely within the discretion of the court to determine whether it is too doubtful to warrant the issue of an injunction EQUITY RESCISSION OF CONTRACT FOR MUTUAL MISTAKE OF FACT The defendant employed a real estate broker to sell for him property on a cer tain avenue The broker pointed out to the plaintiff houses on another avenue as the ones for sale and after inspection the plaintiff

Peerage Case I I Cl  Fin 85 1 13 His remark though not necessary to the decision has been followed by the English judges Reg v Buckley 13 COx C C 293 The present case seems opposed to Reg v Buckley though it may perhaps be reconciled with it on the ground that a physician frequently refrains from telling his patients the truth about their condition and that therefore statements made under such circumstances are not so trustworthy as those made under a positive duty to tell the truth The two cases are otherwise in conflict however and the present one may mark the return of the English courts to their old rule The law on the point in this country is not settled but shows little tendency to accept the doctrine of Reg v BLckley Cf Williams v Walton and Whann Co 9 Houst Del 322 9 HARV L REV

Ins Co 13 Hun N Y I44 EVIDENCE HEARSAY  AGE OF WITNESS On a trial for statutory rape the age of the prosecutrix being in issue objection was made to lher competency to prove her own age on the ground that her knowledge of it was obtained out side of her family though from a person B with whom she had lived as an orphan field that the evidence is not admissible People v Colbath 104 N W Rep 633 Mich Though the statement may not be in regard to pedigree and strictlv speaking is hearsay the broad view is usually taken that as the statement of a witness regarding his own age is sufficient in practical affairs of life it should be admis sible Cheever v Congdon 34 Mich 296 And it will be admitted though his parent is present and though it appears that his knowledge came from the par ent Loose v State 120 Wis 115 But the statement of B herself as to the age of a person not a member of her family would not have been admissible Sizpson v State 81 S W Rep 320 see 9 HARV L REV 486 And it fol lows as a logical step from this rule that the fact of passing through one more individual though that one happens to be the person whose age is in question should not make that admissible which was before inadmissible Cf State v Cougot 121 Mo 458 If the contrary view were taken it would follow that the rule limiting evidential statements of age to members of the family of the person whose age is in question should be extended to include those who would be likely to know irrespective of relationship This would of course be an exten sion with vague limits but might be wise in the case of an orphan entirely without family or where none of the family knew ILLEGAL CONTRACTS  CONTRACTS AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY  AGREF MENTS BETWEEN OFFICEHOLDERS AS TO TERMS OF OFFICE At the first election after the death of one alderman of a board of eight four of whom were elected annuallyfor a term of two years five were chosen with no specification as to which should have the short term The question could not be settled by the three aldermen whose terms were not in dispute since they did not consti tute the necessary quorum One of the new members agreed to take the short term on condition that the others vote for him for president of the board Elected president at the end of the year he refused to withdraw Held that the contract is not contrary to public policy and that the defendant may be compelled to resign Hobbs v Upington 89 S W Rep I28 Ky The position of the court in enforcing such a contract must be regarded as extremely questionable The defendant induced his colleagues to vote for him for president of the board by promising them an undisputed twoyear term If he had offered money for the same purpose the agreement clearly would have been void as against public policy Swayze v Hull 8 N J Law 54 Similarly his colleagues induced him to promise to withdraw at the end of the year by agreeing to vote for him for president Here again if they had offered money to procure his withdrawal the agreement would have been contrary to public policy Eddy v Cap ron 4 R I 394 The fact that the consideration on each side was political office instead of money does not alter the priticiples involved See Stroud v Smvith 4 Houst Del 448 When the substance of a contract is the bartering of public offices for private and unworthy motives no equitable ground for its specific enforcement can be found INSURANCE  RIGHTS OF INSURER  EFFECT OF INSUREDS GRANTING ABATEMENT IN PRICE TO VENDEE  The defendant agreed to sell to the Corporation of Plymouth certain premises which had been insured by the plain tiff Before the title was transferred some buildings were burned and the insurance was collected by the defendant Thereafter the defendant released to the Corporation of Plymouth his claim for an amount of the purchase price equivalent to the amount of the insurance money The plaintiff sued the defendant to obtain the value of this right that was released Held that it can recover Phwvnix Assurance Company v Spooner 1905 2 K B 753RECENT CASES 303 Having decided that the vendee of premises that had been burned before the transfer of title has no right to the insurance money which the vendor receives the English courts were confronted with the alternative of allowing the vendor to recover double compensation for his loss or of subrogating the insurance company to the vendors rights against the vendee Cf Rayner v Preston i8 Ch D I The latter alternative was chosen and the present case merely reenforces that decision Cf Castellain v Preston II Q B D 380 The courts of this country feeling that the insurance money really stands in the place of the destroyed propertv have held that like the property which it represents such money belongs in justice to the vendee Skinner etc City v Houghton 92 Md 68 82 This view is a departure from the doctrine wlhich has found favor in England that a policy of insurance is a contract of personal indemnity But the American position is justified on equitable grounds since it places the loss upon the insurance company which has been paid to sustain it and relieves the vendee from the necessity of paying for what he does not receive MORTGAGES  MERGER OF INTERESTS  TRANSFER OF DEPBENTURES AFTER PAYMENT  A company issued debentures as a first charge on its property agreeing to create no charges in priority to or upon an equal footing with them Some of these debentures it issued to A as security for a loan Later the loan was paid off by the company and the debentures returned by A together with blank transfers The company then having applicaticns for debentures transferred these same debentures to the applicants who paid their full value and were registered as holders At the winding up of the company these transferees claimed equal priority with the other debenture holders Held that they are not entitled tlhereto since their debentures were either extin guished by payment or if kept alive could not be set up against the other debenture holders In re W Taskers  Sons Ltd 1905 2 Ch 587 When the owner of property subject to a mortgage acquires the mortgage equity will prevent the extinction of the mortgage by merger if an intention to keep it alive can be found or in the absence of evidence of intention if it will be to the owners advantage to keep it alive provided it will not perpetrate a fraud on third parties Forbes v Afof2ftt i8 Ves Jun 390 But since equity will not aid fraud it lias been hield that when a mortgage debt is paid by one who is bound to pay it and upon whom the burden of payment ought to fall an assignment of it to him operates as a discharge Burnhamn v Dorr 72 Me I98 see also JONES MORTGAGES 5th ed 864 Under this rule a mortgagor who has acquired a first mortgage made by himself cannot set it up against a subsequent mortgage also made by himself Otter v Vaulx 6 De G M  G 638 It would seem equally unfair to let him set it up against a contempo

discretion and not as a matter of law See Comnonwealth v White 147 Mass 76 POWERS  EXECUTION BY RESIDUARY DEVISE  A testator having a special power of appointment left a will which purported to dispose of all the property he owned or over which he had any power of disposition The will did not mention the power but contained a general residuary clause Held that the power is executed in favor of the residuary legatees who are members of the class specified by the donor of the power Stonze v Forbes I89 MIass I63 The old common law rule in force in nearly all of the states unless changed by statute is that a power of appointment is not exercised by a general resid uary devise of all the testators estate A further intention to appoint must appear Hollister v Shaw 46 Conn 248 Massachusetts has departed from the rule in the case of general powers by holding that a residuary devise suffi ciently indicates the intention to appoint Amory v Meredith 7 Allen Mass 397 An effort was made to distinguish the present case because it involves a special power English decisions make such a distinction in construing the Wills Act In re Hayes 1900 2 Ch 332 The Massachusetts court says that as the intent to exercise the power is sufficiently expressed to satisfy the comnmon law rule they need not decide the point but the opinion intimates that the special power would have been treated like a general one if the intent had not been found Nortlh Carolina follows the Massachusetts decisions in a case involving a special power without mentioning the distinction Johnzston v KAnight 117 N C 122 And Massachusetts will probably refuse to treat the two kinds of powers differently as there is quite as much reason for holding that the testator intended the residuary legatee to be the

W had commenced an action against the defendant in the present action as garnishee of H the judgment debtor The garnishment action failed and in the present action the plaintiff maintains that a finding in the garnishment proceeding is resjudicata as between himself and the defendant Held that the plaintiff was neither party nor privy to the pro ceedings in the garnishment action and that the finding in it is therefore not resudicata in the present suit Alen v Elis 104 N WV Rep 739 Wis The general rule is that an assignee is privy to judgments rendered in suits on the chose assigned if the suits were begun before the assignment Corcoran v Chesapeake etc Co 94 U S 741 The question raised in this case was whether the garnishment action is intimately enough related to the original judgment to bind the assignee of the judgment The garnishment proceeding was merely auxiliary to execution on the judgment assigned Garland v McKittrick 52 Wis 261 That the garnishment proceeding was not specifically assigned is of course not conclusive against its binding the assignee Block v Commnissioners 99 U S 686 Furthermore the fact that it was based on the judgment and might have involved a finding that the judgment was void seems to show its necessary connection with the judgment Beaupre v Brighanm 79 Wis 436 An additional consideration pointing to this result is that the assignee would be entitled to the proceeds of the garnishment Builitt  Faiirhorme v Afethodlist Episcopal Church 26 Pa St Io8 The contrary view would seem to allow the assignee to bring a new garnishment action against the same garnishee raising the same issues and successive assignees would have in definitely the same power of continual litigation This is against the funda mental policy of the law of resjudicata Cf Bislanzd v Grojin 9 La An 150 RES JUDICATA  PERSONS CONCLUDED  CODEFENDANTS  A decree in equity declared that C one of two defendants was entitled to a certain sum of money which the plaintiff A claimed as judgmentcreditor of B tile other de fendant B now brinas this action against C for the same sum Held that tlle decree operates as a bar to his right on the principle of resjidiatz Elis v Cole 105 N Y App Div 48 If As claim against C is derived from and is as great as that of B against C and if A fails to establish his case then B is barred from asserting his claim against C in a subsequent suit Cohen v Sztnfison 32 S WV Rep 59 In the case under discussion the decree in equity necessarily involved the decision that C was entitled to the money as against B for otherwise A would have been en titled to it since his claim was admitted to be as great as that of B The provi sion in the Code  521 requiring a defendant to notify his codefendant when he wishes to establish his rights against such codefendant as well as against the plaintiff does not apply to cases where these rights are necessarily involved in a judgment for or against the plaintiff since the Code provision was not intended to interfere with the principles of resjudicata ratt v Johnston 59 N Y App Div 52 RESTRICTIVE AGREEMENTS AS TO USE OF PROPERTY CHANGE IN CHAIt ACTER OF LOCALITY AS

benefit  but it may be used even though the order in which the devisees take is tlhereby changed See GRAY RULE AGAINST PERP  647 649 In order to give effect to the testators intention in the present case an unusual condition transforming vested into contingent remainders was invented Had the court been inclined to look with favor upon the doctrine such an expedient would probably have been sanctioned The decision how ever is in harmony with the disposition of the English court to restrict the doctrine of cyrs Cf In re Richardson I904 I Ch 332 STATUTES  INTERPRETATION  WHETHER APPOINTEE OF LEGISLATURE MAY EXTEND ITS POWER BEYOND EXACT WORDING OF STATUTE  A statute gave the county courts of the state power subject to a local option law to grant liquor licenses to adults of good moral character The plaintiff was granted a lic2nse by the county court of his county with the provision that the license might be revoked by the same court if the plaintiff violated the local liquor laws The plaintiff broke the Sunday law and the county court revoked lhis license Held that the plaintiff has no legal ground for complaint One justice dis sented Sarlo v Pulaski Couity 88 S W Rep 953 Ark A state legislature under its police power can control the sale of liquor within the state and may properly delegate to suibordinate bodies the right of local control Metropolitac Board of Excise v Barrie 34 N Y 657 It beinc admitted that the legislature in the present case might properly have given the county court power to grant revocable licenses the question remains did it in fact do so Cf Schwuchow v City of Chicago 68 Ill 444 The courts in interpreting a statute usually assume in the absence of a strong reason for a contrary holding that the legislature intended to reserve what it did not grant Laizttz v Hihtstown 46 N J Law 102 The present decision however asserts that power to grant to proper persons includes power to revoke The only case on this precise point is in accord Gerstltaers License 5 Pa Dist Reps 97 The view of the dissenting justice tlhat until power is expressly or by necessary implication granted the court should not assume it to have been granted seems to conform more closely to the general current of statutory interpretation The suggestion that the welfare of the community demands the broader construction is not controlling inasmuch as anotherRECENT

committed at a time antecedent to the entry Ocean Accident etc Corporation v Iford Gas Co I905 2 K B 493 The old doctrine allowing a disseisee on reentry to sue for trespasses com mitted during his dispossession has been given a broader scope in a case hold ing that the possession of an heir relates back to the time his right of entry accrued Litchfield v Ready 5 Exch Rep 939 Barnett v Earl of Guild ford i I Exch Rep i9 The only difficulty of the present case lies in the fact that here the plaintiff does not have the full and unincumbered legal title but since possession is the essential point in trespass and the plaintiff had here a legal right to enter and take possession at the time of the trespass the case seems to fall within the spirit of as well as within the doctrine laid down in the former decision See Auderson v Radcliffe and Walker E B  E 8o6 Several Amnerican cases are based on the even broader rule that recovery may be had when the mortgagor has not yet entered providing only that his right of entry dates back to the time of the trespass Harris v 1laynes 34 Vt 220 If this is a departure from the original conception of trespass it seems desirable as promoting
